We are pleased to announce yourself on Kickstarter with a small django package, for more info please read the description on the [Kickstarter.com][kickstarter]. Kickstarter is the best way to get an independent assessment and the opportunity to listen to your opinion. It also allows us to assess the demand for the development of necessary packages, as well as make it easier for us, the developers, to increase your efficiency.

![Kickstarter]({{ '/img/02-01/kickstarter.png' | prepend: site.baseurl}})

Our task is to help to the django developers community by simplifying theirs life.
In any case, we will implement the project even if the campaign fail, **but your help** would motivate us in the future
to develop much-needed community packages that are suitable for use in real production projects.
