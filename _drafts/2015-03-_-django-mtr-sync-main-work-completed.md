## What's going on
After mouthes of continuous work, testing and improving package we make a new conception of data processing. The main question is - "Why you not release it yet?" the answer is - "Due to critical architecture changes and unpolished must have features invented in development process.

Docs, docs, docs! The main problem of project for now is lack of quality docs. To solve this problem we will do an `docs weeks` when commits will be only docs, no additional functionality (bug fixes only).

## Features implemented

### Inline integration
This is one of the coolest and new features in *market*, and flexibility of settings let you do what-ever you want, without writing bunch of repetitive code.

### Before, after, error handlers


### Action context

### Transaction management on demand

##Where is my dashboard app?
As you can see

## Utilization of functionality
In `mtr.sync` project structure you can find `helpers.py` files, they will be moved to separate package called `mtr.utils`. We think this package will include all annoying django shortcuts, mixins, helpers. There are a lot of similar packages but they don't have flexibility that we want, for example, auto construction of model fields fabric, so simple *write less do more*.

## New architecture

The biggest mistake was a prioritizing of table processing, the idea is not bad at all, but when you need to import or export xml, json data API will have a huge differences of base `Processor` class. We decided to move from raw `list` values to `dicts` with nested structures. It's a more flexible way to manipulate data and process it with action handlers. Also there are many different data sources not only files, so we must unlink file manipulation from processing.

For better understanding you can see diagram below

## Work progress
Also nice feature is to include progress status when you dealing with long running action

## Roadmap



## What package ca
- Import (only creating), export data
- Processor API for supporting other formats
- Uses Celery for background tasks and for processing large volumes of data
- Creates reports about importing and exporting operations
- Auto discovering models for use in package
- Data range settings (start, end cells in table), for example, if you need to import data where there is a header with logo or any other unnecessary information
- Field settings:
  - maps model fields with data fields
  - adds and removes fields (ability to skip fields on import)
  - related models(fields, supports only ForeignKey) import-export by choosing main model
- Supports: CSV(native python3), XLS (using: xlwt-future, xlrd), XLSX (using: openpyxl optimized writer, reader mode, for fast processing of large volumes of data)
- Saves import, export settings for the processing of data from various sources and for simplicity
- Integration with standard django admin app
- Supports: Django 1.7 Python 2.7, 3.3+ (Django 1.6 will be added soon)
